    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo notebook relates to the following [Qiskit Nature](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/apidocs/qiskit_nature.html) pull requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Migrate MP2Info [#590](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/pull/590)\n",
    "* Add HF initial point [#632](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/pull/632)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to adding the option of using a Møller-Plesset-informed initial point for [VQE](https://qiskit.org/documentation/stubs/qiskit.algorithms.VQE.html) with a [UCC](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/stubs/qiskit_nature.circuit.library.UCC.html)+[HF](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/stubs/qiskit_nature.circuit.library.HartreeFock.html) ansatz, these PRs address Issue [#571](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/issues/571) by introducing [explicit initial points](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/apidocs/qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points.html#module-qiskit_nature.algorithms.initial_points) in [VQEUCCFactory](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/stubs/qiskit_nature.algorithms.VQEUCCFactory.html) and [VQEUVCCFactory](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/stubs/qiskit_nature.algorithms.VQEUVCCFactory.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Set-up\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo was tested using Qiskit Nature `0.4.1`. The release notes for `0.4.0` can be found [here](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/release_notes.html#release-notes-0-4-0).\n",
    "\n",
    "The following shell code should provide a suitable environment to run this demo.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "    python3.9 -m venv .venv\n",
    "    source .venv/bin/activate\n",
    "    pip install qiskit-nature==0.4.1\n",
    "    pip install qiskit-aer==0.10.4\n",
    "    pip install pyscf==2.0.1\n",
    "    pip install ipykernel==6.15.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Explicit initial points\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, the VQE+U(V)CC factories implicitly set the initial point within Qiskit Terra's VQE algorithm. This led to the problems raised in Issue [#571](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/issues/571); primarily, obfuscation of how and where the initial point was selected.\n",
    "\n",
    "To resolve this, we have made explicit classes to compute the relevant initial point for a given ansatz. For example, to use VQE UCC with a Hartree-Fock initial point.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    hf_initial_point = HFInitialPoint()\n",
    "    vqe_ucc_factory = VQEUCCFactory(quantum_instance, initial_point=hf_initial_point)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is also the default behavior when `initial_point=None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "They can also be used outside of the factories by passing the result directly to the VQE.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    hf_initial_point = HFInitialPoint()\n",
    "    hf_initial_point.ansatz = your_ucc_ansatz\n",
    "    initial_point = hf_initial_point.to_numpy_array()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll see a full example of this below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Møller-Plesset 2nd order corrections\n",
    "\n",
    "Qiskit Aqua featured a utility class [MP2Info](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-aqua/blob/main/qiskit/chemistry/mp2info.py) that computed the [Møller-Plesset 2nd order corrections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%B8ller%E2%80%93Plesset_perturbation_theory). This is now re-introduced in Qiskit Nature using an explicit initial point class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Møller–Plesset perturbation theory (MP) is a method in computational chemistry that improves on the Hartree–Fock method by adding electron correlation effects by means of Rayleigh–Schrödinger perturbation theory (RS-PT). Currently, we have introduced these corrections to second-order (MP2).\n",
    "\n",
    "Each double excitation—indexed by $i,a,j,b$, where $i,j(a,b)$ are the initial(final) orbital indices—has a correction coefficient,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "    c_{i,a,j,b} = -\\frac{2 T_{i,a,j,b} - T_{i,b,j,a}}{E_b + E_a - E_i - E_j},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $E$ is the orbital energy and $T$ is the molecular orbital integral matrix. See the learning resources below for the derivation of these corrections.\n",
    "\n",
    "The double-excitation coefficients are intended to be used as initial point values for the corresponding operators in VQE when using a UCC ansatz. This should introduce an initial point that is closer to the ground state point, leading to fewer evaluations.\n"

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We've given an overview of some recent changes in Qiskit Nature that were introduced in Pull Requests [#590](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/pull/590) and [#632](https://github.com/Qiskit/qiskit-nature/pull/632). These changes were included in the `0.4.0` [release](https://qiskit.org/documentation/nature/release_notes.html#release-notes-0-4-0) of Qiskit Nature.\n",
    "\n",
    "#632 adds Hartree-Fock (HF) and vibrational self-consistent field (VSCF) initial point classes. `HFInitialPoint` and `VSCFInitialPoint` are to be used with `UCC`, and `UVCC` ansatzes, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "This follows the introduction of `MP2InitialPoint` in #590 for computing the initial point using the Møller-Plesset 2nd Order (MP2) corrections. `MP2InitialPoint`, `HFInitialPoint`, and `VSCFInitialPoint` all inherit from the abstract base class `InitialPoint`. These initial points are intended to be used as explicitly-declared starting VQE parameters when using a UCC ansatz. \n",
    "\n",
    "The corresponding double-excitation coefficients from the MP2 corrections are intended to introduce an initial point that is closer to the ground state point, leading to fewer overall evaluations for VQE when compared to the HF initial point.\n",
