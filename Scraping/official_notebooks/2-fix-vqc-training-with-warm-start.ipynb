    "Variational quantum algorithm (VQAs) are near-term, classical-quantum-hybrid algorithms that use a parameterized quantum circuit $U(\\theta)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially this circuit uses some initial guess of the parameters $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0$ (ansatz). \n",
    "We then prepare a state $|\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0) \\rangle = U(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0) |0 \\rangle$ and measure its expectation value.\n",
    "We then use a cost function $C(\\theta)$ that determines how far these expectation values are from the ideal solution.\n",
    "The cost function is evaluated and parameters updated using a classical optimization algorithm: $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_0 \\rightarrow \\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1$.\n",
    "We then prepare the state $|\\psi(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1) \\rangle = U(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}_1) |0 \\rangle$ and evaluate the expectation value again.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cycle of preparation and evaluation of circuit parameters continues until we have sufficiently minimized the cost function.\n",

    "### The variational quantum classifier\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://learn.qiskit.org/content/quantum-machine-learning/images/vqc/vqc.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "The variational quantum classifier (VQC) is a supervised VQA, where the measured expectation value is interpreted as the output of a classifier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider a classification problem with binary target labels $y_i = \\{0,1\\}$ and data feature vectors $\\boldsymbol{x}_i$. For each feature, we build a parameterized quantum circuit that prepares the state of $n$ qubits:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$|\\psi(\\boldsymbol{x}_i;\\boldsymbol{\\theta}) \\rangle =  U_{W(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}U_{\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}_i)}|0 \\rangle,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $U_{\\phi(\\boldsymbol{x}_i)}$ corresponds to the data-encoding circuit and $U_{W(\\boldsymbol{\\theta})}$ corresponds to the variational circuit.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measuring this state provides an $n$-length bitstring. This is mapped to the binary classification label using a boolean function $f: \\{0, 1\\}^{n} \\rightarrow \\{0, 1\\}$, usually the parity function.\n",
    "We then compute the difference between predicted labels $\\hat{y}_i$ and the target labels $y_i$ using the cost function. \n",
    "The classical optimization algorithm selects a new point $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}'$, which is then used to create a new circuit.\n",
    "This training process is repeated until the cost function stabilizes around a minimum point for which $\\boldsymbol{\\theta}$ provides the best predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the [tutorial on VQCs in the Qiskit Textbook Beta](https://learn.qiskit.org/course/machine-learning/variational-classification) for more information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Warm-start training\n",
    "\n",
    "Training a VQC usually begins with initializing the model parameters with randomized values. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, we can initialize the parameters with values saved from a previously trained model. This warm-starting approach enables us to start training from a better initial point on the cost surface. Thus, warm-starting leverages prior computation to pick up where the last training run left off and reduce the time required to train the full model. This is useful for training in batches.\n",
