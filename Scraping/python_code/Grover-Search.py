'''
Demonstrating Grover's search algorithm.

Scenario: We have a phone book containing names and numbers. Because the phone book is sorted alphabetically by names,
it is easy to find a persons phone number by persons name. However, a more difficult task would be if we want to find a person by a phone number.
Number-wise, if we have a million (1 000 000) entries in a phone book, we would on average have to look up half of it to find the correct entry (500 000 lookups).
Worst case complexity is 1 000 000 queries.
Grover's algorithm provides a quadratical speed-up to unstructured search probelms. Applying Grover's algorithm to this problem would reduce the needed amount
of lookups to only 1000, in the worst case.

This program simulates the above scenario on a smaller scale.
