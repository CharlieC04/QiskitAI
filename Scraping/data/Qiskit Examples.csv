Grovers-Algorithm-Implementation-on-3-qubit-database|"In this I have implemented the Grover's algorithm N=8 as database size and the example results are attached. Most of the resources on internet like Qiskit text book constructed the circuit which is applicable to a particular target state only, like if you go to Qiskit textbook you can see the target state for two qubit circuit is taken as \(|11>\)."|udayapeddirajub|1|1|Jupyter Notebook|https://github.com/udayapeddirajub/Grovers-Algorithm-Implementation-on-3-qubit-database|1.0|NO LICENSE
Quantum-Random-Number-Generator|This is a very simple example of using the Qiskit platform to produce random numbers. The bits are specified by the user, and then the code goes into quantum code to determine the random number. It is very simple code, but I thought it was interesting in thinking of random number generation from the quantum perspective. |alexandrepdumont|0|0|Python|https://github.com/alexandrepdumont/Quantum-Random-Number-Generator|1.0|NO LICENSE
