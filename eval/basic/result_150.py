    In each iteration `i`, perform the following:
    1. Apply a `RY` rotation on qubit 0 with an angle of `pi/n * i`.
    2. Apply a Hadamard gate to qubit 0 and a CNOT gate between qubits 0 and 1 to create a phi plus Bell state.
    3. Measure qubit 0 and store the result in the corresponding classical register.
    4. Break the loop if the classical register for qubit 0 measures the value 1.

    Use the `for_loop` control flow structure to implement the loop and include conditional breaking based on the measurement.
