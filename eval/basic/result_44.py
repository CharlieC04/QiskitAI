# ## 3. Quantum Fourier Transform
#
# The quantum Fourier transform (QFT) is a quantum algorithm that performs a discrete Fourier transform on a quantum state. It is a linear transformation that maps a quantum state to another quantum state with a different frequency spectrum. The QFT is a crucial component in many quantum algorithms, including Shor's algorithm for factoring large integers and quantum phase estimation.
#
# The QFT is defined as follows:
#
# $$
# \text{QFT} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \sum_{j=0}^{N-1} e^{2\pi i j k / N} |j\rangle \otimes |k\rangle
# $$
#
# where $N$ is the size of the input state, $j$ and $k$ are integers ranging from 0 to $N-1$, and $i$ is the imaginary unit.
#
# In Qiskit, the Q
